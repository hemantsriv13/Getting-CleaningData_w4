# Getting-CleaningData_w4

The week 4 programming assignment for the JHU Coursera Data Science specialization course - Getting and Cleaning data

The repository includes the following files:
1. ***run_analysis.R*** : The R script containing the code for the assignment.
2. ***CodeBook.md*** : A markdown file containing the details of all variables used and the transformations done on the data.
3. ***tidy_dataset.txt*** : The final tidy dataset containing average value of each variable, for each activity, and each subject.

## Objectives of the assignment

The course requires the attendee to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The same has been achieved in the given files.
